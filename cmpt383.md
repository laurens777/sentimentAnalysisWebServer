# CMPT383 - Final Project

This repository contains the code to run the final project for CMPT383.
For this project I will be creating an app that runs a linguistic analysis on raw text input.

### Languages

For this project a simple web server will be created using C++ and the [Simple-Web-Server](https://gitlab.com/eidheim/Simple-Web-Server) library. The text analysis will be
done using Python and various language proccesing librares such as NLTK. For the web requests I will be using Javascript.

### Inter-Language Communication Methods
For the communication between the two languages I will be using a foreign function interface as well
as writing to a temporary file to capture the output.

### Deployment Technology
For the deployment technology I will be using Docker.
